  "description": "Each SEED token sold will help us fund the Smart Village, which will be a living lab for regenerative innovation in BC, Canada. The SEED token is a badge to show off the fact that you were part of the first Smart Village. It’s an access key to our online community, where we’ll share the inside story, experiments, learnings, and collaboration opportunities as we build the Smart Village. For every SEED token sold, we will plant 1 tree or plant at the Smart Village to regenerate the forest and the ecosystem. Some trees and plants will be used to make buildings, some will be consumed, others may last a lifetime. The SEED token is a limited edition, collectible, evolving art piece that represents this. Each SEED will grow into a different kind of tree or plant. The type of plant it will grow into is random and won’t be revealed until the future. And as if that weren’t cool enough, your plants may even bear fruit. For some of the SEED token holders, we may randomly drop an accommodation token, which is redeemable for a single night stay at the Smart Village. We may also do other experimental airdrops.",
